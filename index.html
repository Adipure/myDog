    <h2>The Poodle, called the Pudel in German and the Caniche in French, is a breed of water dog. The breed is divided into
    four varieties based on size, the Standard Poodle, Medium Poodle, Miniature Poodle and Toy Poodle, although the Medium
    Poodle variety is not universally recognised.</h2>
    
    <h2>The Poodle is most commonly claimed to have been developed in Germany, although it is also claimed to be from France,
    the Standard Poodle was originally used by wildfowl hunters to retrieve game from water. The smaller varieties of the
    breed were bred from the original in France where they were once commonly used as circus performers, but have become
    popular companion dogs.
